About

    * This radar has two modes one which only displays something if it is in 
    the range of the radar and the second displays a continuous line in a circle around the inside of the oscilloscope display like a real radar - the tracking and detection on this one is reversed as to the other configuration as the range gets smaller rather than bigger e.g
    * This means that it is less reliable than the other one and the points
     are quite vague as to where the object it is detecting is.
    * The 0 default radar configuration means that the readings are more accurate 
    and you can tell better what direction the object is. This is the only radar that actually works so enjoy! 

Construction

   1. spawn a half pipe as big as you want
   2. spawn a ranger set the max range to 10000
 and place it in the center 
of the half pipe (make sure you select showbeam)
   3. spawn a 1x1 plate and using the axis tool 
weld the halfpipe to the plate
   4. using the thruster tool attach a thruster 
to the side of the halfpipe 
to make it spin set the force and max to 10 and
 select toggle (set this to any key you like)
   5. now you have a rotating radar dish with a ranger on it! 

    * now you need to follow the wiring steps 

Wiring

   1. spawn a sin(deg) gate, a Cos(Deg) gate, a constant value 
with the value 
set as the max range of your ranger, 2 multiply gates
 and an oscilloscope put 
all this on a plate or whatever you want. 

    * now the wiring 

   1. wire the A of the sin(deg) gate to the yaw 
on the gyroscope and do the 
same with the cos(deg) gate

   2. divide gate's A to the 
ranger's range and the B to the 
constant value
   3. multiply gates A's to e divide gate

   4. then wire the multiply gate's B's to the cos(deg) gate and sin(deg) 
gate alternatively #

   5. finally wire the oscilloscopes X and Y to one of the
 multiply gates for each one 

    * You've made a radar now try it out
